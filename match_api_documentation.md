## Important Notes

### 1. Matching Algorithm
- Only shows verified users with complete profiles
- Excludes users you've already swiped on (skip or love)
- Excludes users you've blocked or who blocked you
- Respects your age range and distance preferences

### 2. Connection Flow
1. **Skip Action:** User is removed from your potential matches, no notification sent
2. **Love Action:** 
   - If they already loved you ‚Üí Instant match üéâ
   - If they haven't ‚Üí Connection request sent, waiting for response ‚ù§Ô∏è
3. **Accept Request:** Creates mutual connection (match)
4. **Reject Request:** Removes the request, they won't know

### 3. Match vs Connection Request
- **Match:** Both users loved each other (mutual connection)
- **Connection Request:** One-sided love, waiting for response
- Only matches can message each other

### 4. Request Status
- `pending` - Waiting for response
- `accepted` - Now a match (can chat)
- `rejected` - Request declined

### 5. Swipe Actions
Only two actions are supported:
- `skip` - Pass on this user
- `love` - Send love/like to this user

### 6. Pagination Support
- Use `page` and `limit` query parameters for potential matches
- Default: page 1, limit 10
- Response includes `meta` object with total count

### 7. Match Notifications
- When you get a match, you should receive it via Socket.IO
- Connection requests appear in `/match/requests` endpoint
- Check Socket documentation for real-time match events

### 8. Important Checks
- Users must have mutual connection to send messages
- Cannot swipe on the same user twice
- Cannot send connection request if already connected
- Blocked users won't appear in potential matches

### 9. Error Responses

All errors follow this structure:
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "Error message here",
  "errorSources": [
    {
      "path": "fieldName",
      "message": "Field-specific error message"
    }
  ],
  "err": { "issues": [...], "name": "ZodError" },
  "stack": "..."
}
```

**HTTP Status Codes:**
- `400` - Invalid action type, user ID, or validation error
- `403` - Cannot perform action (blocked, no profile, etc.)
- `404` - User not found or request not found
- `409` - Already interacted with this user
